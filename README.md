## Background

Extractive Question Answering

In Natural-Language Processing, Q&A tasks are broken into Extractive or Abstractive
**Extractive** = highlight the answer where you see it in the text
**Abstractive** = formulate a short sentence that articulates the answer

This code is the former. Using the LARGE_MODEL, the answer_question method successfully achieves the same results for the examples given in this article: [https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-train-question-answering-machine-learning-models](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-train-question-answering-machine-learning-models)

**What does the neural network look like?**
[This article](https://mccormickml.com/2020/03/10/question-answering-with-a-fine-tuned-BERT/) by Chris McCormick gives a great overview.
